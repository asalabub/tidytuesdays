This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r cache=TRUE}
# Get the Data

# Read in with tidytuesdayR package 

install.packages("tidytuesdayR")


# This loads the readme and all the datasets for the week of interest

# Either ISO-8601 date or year/week works!

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2021-04-20')
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2021, week = 17)

netflix <- tuesdata$netflix

write.csv(netflix, "netflix.csv")

# Or read in the data manually

netflix_titles <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-04-20/netflix_titles.csv')

```



```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(gganimate)
netflix2 <- netflix %>%
       group_by(type, release_year) %>%
       tally()
       

graph <- ggplot(netflix2, aes(x = release_year, y = n, color=type)) +
       geom_line() 


graph2.animation <- graph +
  transition_reveal(release_year) + 
  view_follow(fixed_y = T, fixed_x = T)

graph2.animation
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
